- consider rotating the transform, not the camera
- cubeFractal needs color control from tidal params. sync colors to scenes, or additional shapes too
- cubePops fix rotation? not centered?
- cubePops a/b vals are wonky. a only produces large grid sizes centered around 0.5
- reg synth doesn't vary enough. needs rework. not fun.
- reg1 shows grid lines
- rain shows grid lines
- nodes lines stop connecting
